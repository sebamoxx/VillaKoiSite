/**
 * Real asset preloading for the jumboKoi "curtain".
 *
 * The Preloader doesn't fake progress with a timer — it warms the exact images
 * the first screens need, so by the time the curtain lifts the Hero frame
 * sequence, the Collection koi and the Atelier morph are already in the browser
 * HTTP cache and paint without a flash. The frame plan (count, folders, names,
 * mobile subset) is imported from utils/frames so it can NEVER drift from what
 * the Hero actually draws — every `new Image()` the sections make is a cache hit.
 *
 * ⚠️ MEMORY DISCIPLINE — read before touching this file
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * We deliberately DO NOT call `img.decode()` here. `.decode()` forces the browser
 * to allocate the full uncompressed RGBA bitmap (~7.9 MB per 1080×1920 frame) and
 * keep it resident. Doing that across all 192 frames in parallel = ~1.48 GB, which
 * instantly OOM-kills the iOS Safari tab and triggers the "A problem repeatedly
 * occurred" reload loop. Warming the *bytes* into the HTTP cache (what `onload`
 * signals) is all we need; the browser decodes each frame lazily, one at a time,
 * when the Hero canvas actually draws it. Keep it that way.
